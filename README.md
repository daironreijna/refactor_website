## Description

The focus of this project is to refactor's Horiseon Marketing Agency's existing website to make it more accessible. 

I have been hired by a marketing agency to take on this project, which will allow me to showcase my expertise, and deliver a high quality and user friendly website. The impact of this project is meaningful in three ways/areas. 
- 1 People with disabilities can easily access and use Horiseon's website. 
- 2 Horiseon will increase their client base, as the lack of accessible websites causes people with disabilities to abandon websites prematurely. 
- 3 The website's search engine visibility will be improved.


## Motivation

I am motivated to take on this project, as it will allow me to champion accessibility by doing my part to ensure digital experiences are inclusive for all people. I am eager to challenge myself and improve my skills. Working on this project affords me the opportunity to broaden my expertise and knowledge of best practices in web development and user experience design.


## Approach

Review the existing codebase and identify areas for improvement. Review accessibility standards, user story and acceptance criteria. Develop a plan of action. Execute the plan step by step and amend the plan as the project progresses.

//To do list
Utilise semantic HTML, add 'alt' descriptors.
Improve website structure and ensure accesibility e.g. navigation, screen readers etc.
Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
Optimizing the code for efficiency and maintainability. 
Organize the HTML and CSS file with headings, and/or, clear comments.
Have code reviewed prior to final submission to client.
